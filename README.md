TIC TAC TOE GA PROJECT

ABOUT

This is my first project for General Assembly Web Development Immersive. It is a Tic Tac Toe game, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Angular JS.

My goal is to make it functional for separate device multiplayer and compatible with mobile devices. And above all, to make a FUN game!
